#Introduction
#Though there are a number of ways you can go about tackling this project, we recommend using NumPy and pandas.
#Using these libraries is the industry standard for working with data in Python. In the quizzes in this and the following sections,
#you will get some practice using NumPy and pandas to complete different parts of the project. Then for the project,
#you will need to piece your code together with some additional code to complete a final project!
#These sections will likely be helpful if you use NumPy and pandas to complete the project.

#Understanding the Data
#Let's use pandas to better understand the bike share data! Use this code editor to explore chicago.csv and answer the questions below.
#The file included here is a mini version of one of the actual data files you will work with for the project.
#It only includes 400 rows, but the structure and columns are the same.

#1. What columns are in this dataset?
#2. Are there any missing values?
#3. What are the different types of values in each column?
#4. Some useful pandas methods:

#df.head()
#df.columns
#df.describe()
#df.info()
#df['column_name'].value_counts()
#df['column_name'].unique()


import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("chicago.csv")
print(df.head())  # start by viewing the first few rows of the dataset!
