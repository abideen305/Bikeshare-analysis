#: Display a Breakdown of User Types
#There are different types of users specified in the "User Type" column. Find how many there are of each type and store the counts in a pandas Series in the user_types variable.

#Hint: What pandas function returns a Series with the counts of each unique value in a column?

import pandas as pd

filename = 'chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = 

# print value counts for each user type
user_types = 

print(user_types)
